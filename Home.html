    <h1>Hello I am Paragraph</h1>
    <p>A paragraph is a <u>series of related sentences</u> developing 
        a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about 
        paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a <b>paragraph</b> is a 
        sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central,
         unified <i>idea</i>. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader
          argument.</p>
